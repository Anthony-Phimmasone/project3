Synopsis
We are a programming team working for Bicycle Parts Distributorship. 
BPD has a warehouse full of bicycle parts. 
The code and underlying data structures from Projects 1 and 2 apply to Project 3, but we will have to modify them. 
In this increment of the project BPD has identified several users of the software.  
There is a system administrator who creates, removes, and manages accounts. Additionally, can reset password.
There is an office manager who is responsible for many business aspects, such as examining parts, restocking parts, and using invoice to generate a sales commission. 
There is a warehouse manager who updates the warehouse inventory.
There is one sales associate in each sales van who sells bike parts to customers and creates an sales invoice.
In our program, these employees (system administrator, office manager, warehouse manager, and sales associates) have accounts that allow them to perform actions that are specific to their duties. 
The duties that each type of employee performs are described in various use case scenarios. 

What does the project do?
The intent for our program for project 3 was to create a software program for clients that are bike part distributorship companys.
Our program contains actions for various accounts that are specific to their employee duties. 
System administrator duties includes create, remove, and manage accounts. Additionally, this employee can reset password.
Office manager duties includes examining parts, restocking parts, and using sales invoice to generate a sales commission.
Warehouse manager's duty include updating warehouse inventory.
Sales associate duties includes selling bike parts to clients and generating a sales invoice.


How is it set up?


How is it used?
When the program is executed and starts running, a login screen will appear and prompt the user to enter in an employee's username and password of their login account. 
There are four different employees that will have login account information: system administrator, office manager, warehouse manager, and sales associate. 
Once the user enters the information for one of the employee on the login screen, the screen will open to the specific page for that employee with the actions and duties for that employee. 
If the user enters a login account information that does not exist, login screen will indicate to the user that the login account information given is not available.
Each employee page is divided by tabs in our program.

Collaboration:
1. Andy Luong
My first contribution towards my team was creating the GitHub repository for our project 3 code classes.
My initial code contribution for my Group Project 3 team was pushing the basic classes that we needed to begin our project.
These classes included Main, Part, BikePart, Person, LoginAccount, Warehouse, Observer, and SalesItem.
If I had made any errors or did not include parts needed for each class, my teammates would inform me of the problem(s) and they would edit my code on GitHub. 
Another major code contribution that I implemented for our Group Project is creating the classes to build the Sales Invoice. 
These classes included SalesInvoice, InvoiceFormatter interface, SalesItem interface, SimpleFormatter, InvoiceTester, and DiscountedItem. 
Once again, if I had made any errors or did not include parts needed for each class, my teammates would inform me of the problem(s) and they would edit my code on GitHub.
I also contributed in the code by adding or editing Javadoc comments for each class.
