We are a programming team working for Bicycle Parts Distributorship. 
BPD has a warehouse full of bicycle parts. 
The code and underlying data structures from Projects 1 and 2 apply to Project 3, but we will have to modify them. 
In this increment of the project BPD has identified several users of the software.  
There is an office manager who keeps track of many business aspects, there is a warehouse manager, and there is one sales associate in each sales van.
In our program, these employees (office manager, warehouse manager, and sales associates) have accounts that allow them to perform actions that are specific to their duties. 
The duties that each type of employee performs are described in various use case scenarios. 
Additionally, there is a system administrator who manages accounts.

What does the project do?


How is it set up?


How is it used?
When the program is executed and starts running, a login screen will appear and prompt the user to enter in an employee's username and password of their login account. 
There are four different employees that will have login account information: system administrator, office manager, warehouse manager, and sales associate. 
Once the user enters the information for one of the employee on the login screen, the screen will open to the specific page for that employee with the actions and duties for that employee. 
Each employee page is divided by tabs in our program.
